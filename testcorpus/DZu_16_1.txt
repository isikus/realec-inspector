The graph demonstrates the dynamics of changing the number of children, which could not be able to get primary school education because of the specifics of their region and gender.
The chart illustrates the period from 2000 to 2012. As for the number of children, it counts in millions. Each column of the graph is divided into two parts by gender, and the whole scheme is shared by the region. It is necessary to notice, that all regions are parts of continents, which are considered to be less explored and developed. They are Africa, and Asia. Another important detail id the fact of decreasing the amount of children without primary education to 2012, especially in South Asia, where difference is 16,8 million persons between girls and 6,0 millions between boys. However, there are not such great changes in Africa and Rest of World. It is possible to registrate decreasing process in Africa, where results are equal 5,5 million children in average. Besides of that, the number of young people without access to education is still high. As for the Rest of World, more girls nowadays are allowed to go to school, although there were almost no changes between boys.
To sum up, the presence of strict ties between the region and the gender is absolutely obvious. Especially this fact is true about Africa, where a great deal of children have not still got access to primary school education, although the process of changing continuing.
