Air travel is the most safety and convinienced way to travel. But some people argue that it leads to some natural problems such as air pollution and global warming. In my opinion, this decision will not solve the problem.
Air transport is the most fastest and convinienced kind of transports. It allows people to go over the big territory without spending a lot of times. In a few hours a person can be in the other side of our planet. Also, there an opinion that air transport is the most saffiest. The amount of air crashing is lower than car accidents. In addition, the government’s idea to introduce laws which will be regulate the amount of air travel, can prohibit people’s law on free movement.
On the other side, nowadays there are a lot of ecological problems. Air travel has a negative impact on environment. Air pollution is caused the problems with people’s health. Also, it has negative impacts on animals and plants. Global warming is another serious problem that mainly caused by air travel. Global warming may leads to floadings, than, a big territory of lands may be under the water.
To sum up, I disagree with government’s idea to reduce the amount of air travel. Air transport is very helpful for people nowadays. To solve problem with negative impacts on nature, people should improve air technologies. Introduce special laws it is not good way out of this situation.
